Refactoring Horiseon website for Homework 1

The motivation of the project was to refactor the Horiseon website to hone HTLM and CSS skills
From this project I learnt how to properly style a HTML file in the correct format, add comments to existing code and commit changes to github





## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I have a codebase that follows accessibility standards
Our website is now optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## Appearance

The webpage begins with a header on the left and a navigation bar on the right
We then have a large image showing four people working collaboratively
On the left-hand side of the page we have a section of containers with images and text
On the right-hand side of the page we have another section with icons and text
At the bottom of the page we have a footer

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
